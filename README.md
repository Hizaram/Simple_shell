# DESCRIPTION
Simple_shell is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.

The simple_shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands. The simple_shell implements a language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features in addition to data storage, along with built in history and line editing capabilities. It incorporates many features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use(shell scripts). That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell.

# REQUIREMENTS
In this project, We are expected to look indepthly into:
1. How does a shell work
2. What is a pid and a ppid
3. How to manipulate the environment of the current process
4. What is the difference between a function and a system call
5. How to create processes
6. What are the three prototypes of main
7. How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
8. How to execute another program with the execve system call
9. How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
10. What is EOF / “end-of-file”?
